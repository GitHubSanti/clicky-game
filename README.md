# Clicky Game

This is a React based memory game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Play

* The application renders 12 images in a grid on the screen.
* Each time you click on an image:
  - the grid is shuffled
  - if it's the first time you've clicked on the image, your score is incremented
  - if you've clicked on the same image more than once, your score is reset to zero
* If your score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
* If you refresh the browser, both the Score and Top Score will reset to zero.

## Technologies Used

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org)
